## 📱 About the Project

**Interior Design using Augmented Reality** empowers users to design their living space by virtually placing 3D furniture models inside a room using just a mobile camera. Built with React Native and `@reactvision/react-viro`, this app simulates real-world furniture placement for better visualization and decision-making.
